## Notes

- This template includes both `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files to provide flexibility.
- **It is recommended to use only one of these files based on your preferred package manager.**
- If you prefer npm, keep `package-lock.json` and delete `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- If you prefer pnpm, keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` and delete `package-lock.json`.
- Ensure you only keep one lock file to avoid conflicts during dependency installation.
