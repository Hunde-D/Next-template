I'll create a Next.js starter template with npm and pnpm support, incorporating shadcn/ui components and next-themes for dark mode support. I'll also design a nice landing page that showcases the features of this template. Let's get started!

```typescriptreact project="nextjs-starter-template"
...
```

Now that we have the main components and layout set up, let's discuss how to ensure support for both npm and pnpm:

1. Create a `package.json` file with the following scripts:


```json
{
  "name": "nextjs-starter-template",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu": "^2.0.5",
    "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.0.2",
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
    "clsx": "^2.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1",
    "next": "13.4.12",
    "next-themes": "^0.2.1",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "tailwind-merge": "^1.14.0",
    "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.6"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "20.4.5",
    "@types/react": "18.2.18",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.2.7",
    "autoprefixer": "10.4.14",
    "eslint": "8.46.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "13.4.12",
    "postcss": "8.4.27",
    "tailwindcss": "3.3.3",
    "typescript": "5.1.6"
  }
}
```

2. Create a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to support pnpm installations.
3. Add a `.npmrc` file with the following content to ensure consistent installations:


```plaintext
engine-strict=true
```

4. Add a `.nvmrc` file to specify the Node.js version:


```plaintext
v18.16.1
```

5. Update the README.md file to include instructions for both npm and pnpm:


```markdown
